    <h3>Savory, Versatile, & Delicious!</h3>
    <p>I became <em><strong>addicted</strong></em> to this stuff while living in Florence, Italy.</p>
    <p>Serve it over your favorite pasta, dip veggies in it, saute ground meat. <br>
      I can think of few things as versatile and relatively easy to make. <br>
      Enjoy!</p>

    <ul>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <li>1/4 cup <strong>walnuts</strong> or your favorite nut</li>
      <li>1/4 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
      <li>4 cups fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
      <li>2 small garlic cloves</li>
      <li>zest and juice from 1 lemon</li>
      <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <li>Combine all of the ingredients except for the olive oil in a food processor or
        high-powered blender (I used my Vitamix). Pulse on low speed until the ingredients are
        starting to break down. Slowly stream in the oil with the machine on low until the sauce begins
        to come together.</li>
      <li>Make sure to scrape down the sides if you’re using a food processor. If you’re using a blender,
        keep the motor on low and use a tamper/scrape down the sides to make sure your pesto doesn’t become
        too smooth and pureed. You want the ingredients broken up into little bits, but not completely smooth.
        Taste, and add more salt, pepper, and lemon to your tastes. If you want a thinner pesto, add more olive
        oil or add water to get to your desired consistency.</li>
      <li>Pour into an airtight jar or container to store. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or in the
        freezer for a few months.</li>
    </ol>
